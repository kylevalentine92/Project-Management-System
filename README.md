# Project-Management-System

## Project Management System

This program is a basic project management system that can be used by a small engineering firm. This is a perfect project for programmers that are getting into basic Java and wanting to learn more about object orientated programming.

## The Current Program

Currently the program is still in the beginner phases it consists of the first few classes that will be used in this project, and has some basic methods in each class which helps display the information in each object. There is also the current UML diagram which helps define the current classes available in the program and methods for each class, and will show the relationships between these classes.


## Features Of The Project

### The project needs to be able to do:
* Create new projects and update information of the project.
* Finalize the project which creates an invoice for the customer..
* Able to assign employees(contracters and architects) to the project.
* Create and store the information about the customer.
* Pull information in list form of all current projects running.
* Display a list of all projects that are overdue.

## How To Run The Program

To run the code we have created the scripts to initialize all of the classes and also created a test script with comments on how to create each object and use some of the methods.


## Project Progression

This project will have further enhancements and optimimizations in the future.
